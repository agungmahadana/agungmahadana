I'm Agung Mahadana. As a student based in Bali who transitioned from being a graphic designer to a UI/UX designer, I find satisfaction in creative thinking. This extends not only to designing design prototypes but also to the research phase. I enjoy discovering creative ways to enhance questions, making them clearer and easier to understand for others. My goal is not just to create appealing designs but also to ensure that the message I intend to convey can be effectively communicated to users.
